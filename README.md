Programming, programming, reading about programming

What are the three most important tools/strategies you use for organizing your work?
I use a planner to keep track of when assignments are due, I also use folders to help organize all the papers I end up creating when I write down ideas/notes/etc, most importantly I have "sticky note" reminders on my computer to help make sure that I don't forget important things that are going on or that need to be done.
